YSR was not only a visionary leader, but also a compassionate human being who cared for the poor and the needy. He launched several welfare schemes that benefited millions of people in various sectors, such as health, education, employment, housing, pensions, and social security. Some of his notable schemes are:
 
- Aarogyasri: A health insurance scheme that covers the medical expenses of the poor for various diseases and surgeries.
- Rajiv Aarogyasri: A scheme that provides free health check-ups and medicines to school children.
- Indiramma: A scheme that aims to provide housing, drinking water, electricity, roads, and sanitation to the rural poor.
- Pavala Vaddi: A scheme that provides loans to women self-help groups at 3% interest rate.
- Jalayagnam: A massive irrigation project that aims to create new sources of water and link major rivers to provide water security to farmers.
- Rajiv Yuva Kiranalu: A scheme that provides skill development and employment opportunities to the youth.
- Rajiv Swagruha: A scheme that provides affordable housing to the urban middle class.

YSR was also a staunch supporter of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government at the centre, led by the Congress party. He played a key role in securing the support of various regional parties for the UPA in 2004 and 2009. He also maintained cordial relations with other national leaders, such as Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, and Sharad Pawar.
 
YSR's legacy lives on in the hearts and minds of the people of Andhra Pradesh, who remember him as a leader who brought development, prosperity, and social justice to the state. His son, Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy, who is also a politician and the founder of YSR Congress Party, continues to follow his father's footsteps and uphold his ideals.
