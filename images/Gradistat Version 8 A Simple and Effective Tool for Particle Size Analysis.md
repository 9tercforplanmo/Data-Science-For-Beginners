2. Save the file to your computer and open it with Excel. You may need to enable macros to run the program.
3. Enter your data in the Data Entry worksheet. You can use standard or non-standard size classes, but make sure they are consistent and in ascending order.
4. Select the Analysis worksheet and choose the method of calculation (moment or graphical) and the units (metric or phi) from the drop-down menus.
5. Click on the Calculate button to generate the statistics and plots. You can view the results in the Statistics, Frequency Plot, Cumulative Plot, Ternary Plot and Histogram worksheets.
6. You can copy and paste the results and plots to other applications or print them as needed.

Gradistat version 8 is a simple and versatile tool for grain size analysis of unconsolidated sediments. However, if you need more functionality or compatibility with newer versions of Excel, you may want to check out Gradistat version 9.1 or the upcoming Gradistat-PRO[^1^].

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Gradistat
 
Gradistat has many advantages as a grain size analysis software. Some of them are:

- It is free and easy to download and use.
- It can handle data from different measuring techniques and size units.
- It can calculate statistics using different methods and compare them.
- It can assign descriptive terms to the statistics based on Folk and Ward criteria.
- It can produce various graphical outputs that can be customized and exported.

However, Gradistat also has some limitations and disadvantages. Some of them are:

- It requires Microsoft Excel to run and may not be compatible with newer versions or other spreadsheet programs.
- It may not account for some factors that affect grain size measurements, such as grain shape, density and optical properties.
- It may not be suitable for sediments that do not follow a normal or log-normal distribution.
- It may not provide enough functionality or flexibility for some advanced or specific applications.

Therefore, Gradistat is a useful and versatile tool for grain size analysis of unconsolidated sediments, but it may not be the best choice for every situation. Users should be aware of its advantages and disadvantages and choose the appropriate method and software for their research objectives.
