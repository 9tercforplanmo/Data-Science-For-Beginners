# Transformer Design By Indrajit Dasgupta: A Comprehensive Guide for Electrical Engineers
 
Transformers are essential devices for power generation and distribution, as they can step up or step down the voltage and current of alternating current (AC) circuits. The design of a transformer affects its performance, efficiency, reliability and lifespan. Therefore, electrical engineers need to have a thorough understanding of the principles and practices of transformer design.
