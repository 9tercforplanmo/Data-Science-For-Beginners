The family's life changes when Lena receives a $10,000 check from her late husband's life insurance. She decides to use part of the money to buy a house in a white neighborhood called Clybourne Park, hoping to provide a better living environment for her family. She also plans to use some of the money for Beneatha's education. However, Walter has a different idea. He wants to invest the money in a liquor store with his friends, believing that it will make him rich and successful. He begs his mother to give him the money, but she refuses.
 
Walter becomes angry and bitter, feeling that his family does not support his dreams. He clashes with Ruth, who reveals that she is pregnant but does not want another child. He also mocks Beneatha, who has two suitors: George Murchison, a wealthy black man who wants her to be a conventional wife; and Joseph Asagai, a Nigerian student who admires her ambition and culture. Walter feels that Beneatha is wasting her time with both men.
 
Lena eventually gives in to Walter's pressure and entrusts him with the rest of the money. She tells him to keep $3,000 for Beneatha's education and use the rest as he wishes. Walter is overjoyed and promises to make his family proud. He gives the money to his friend Bobo, who is supposed to deliver it to another friend Willie Harris, who has connections with city officials for the liquor license. However, things go wrong when Bobo informs Walter that Willie has run away with all the money.
 
Walter is devastated and ashamed. He has lost his mother's trust and his family's future. He considers accepting an offer from Mr. Lindner, a representative of the Clybourne Park Improvement Association, who tries to bribe the Youngers to not move into their neighborhood. Lena is outraged by Walter's suggestion and reminds him of his father's dignity and pride. She tells him that he has nothing left but his family and that he must stand up for them.
 
Walter finally regains his self-respect and rejects Mr. Lindner's offer. He tells him that his family is proud of who they are and where they come from, and that they have the right to live wherever they want. The Youngers pack their belongings and prepare to move into their new house. They face an uncertain future, but they have each other and their dreams.
