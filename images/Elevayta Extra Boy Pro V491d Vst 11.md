In this article, we will show you how to use Elevayta Extra Boy Pro V491d Vst 11 to remove vocals from any stereo track in a few simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Install and Activate the Plugin
  
To use Elevayta Extra Boy Pro V491d Vst 11, you need to have a compatible host application that supports VST plugins. You can download the plugin from [here](https://www.kvraudio.com/product/extra_boy_pro_by_elevayta) [^1^] for $29.95. After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions to install the plugin on your computer. You will also need to enter your serial number to activate the plugin.
  
## Step 2: Load the Plugin on Your Stereo Track
  
Open your host application and load the stereo track that you want to remove vocals from. Then, insert Elevayta Extra Boy Pro V491d Vst 11 as an effect on the track. You should see the plugin interface with a Spectral-Spatial display of the audio signal.
  
## Step 3: Select and Delete the Vocal Region
  
To remove vocals from the track, you need to select and delete the region that contains the vocal frequencies. To do this, use the mouse to draw a freehand region of interest (ROI) around the vocal signature in the Spectral-Spatial display. You can zoom in and out using the mouse wheel or the buttons at the bottom of the display. You can also use the landmarking tool at the top of the display to cross-correlate features between the Spectral-Spatial and Spectrograph modes.
  
Once you have selected the vocal region, click on the "Delete ROI" button at the bottom right of the plugin interface. This will remove the selected frequencies from the audio signal. You can adjust the gain of the remaining signal using the "Boost" slider at the bottom left of the interface.
  
## Step 4: Listen to the Result and Fine Tune
  
Now you can listen to the result and see how well the plugin has removed vocals from your track. You can switch between "Original" and "Processed" modes using the buttons at the top right of the interface. You can also change the quality mode using the drop-down menu at the top left of the interface. The higher quality modes offer better resolution but require more CPU power.
  
If you are not satisfied with the result, you can fine tune it by drawing more ROIs and deleting or boosting them as needed. You can also undo or redo your actions using the buttons at the bottom center of the interface. You can save your settings as presets using the menu at the top center of the interface.
